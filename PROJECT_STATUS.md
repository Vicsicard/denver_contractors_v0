## Sitemap Issues (December 16, 2024)

### Current Status
- The sitemap is successfully generating and being read by Google Search Console
- Google Search Console shows two sitemaps:
  1. `https://www.topcontractorsdenver.com/sitemap.xml` (24 pages)
  2. `https://topcontractorsdenver.com/sitemap.xml` (24 pages)
- The sitemap URLs are currently using the non-www domain (`https://topcontractorsdenver.com`) instead of the www domain

### Attempted Solutions
1. **Middleware Redirect**
   - Implemented middleware to redirect non-www to www
   - Added specific sitemap.xml redirect
   - Updated robots.txt to specify canonical www sitemap

2. **URL Generation**
   - Tried hardcoding www URLs in sitemap generation
   - Attempted to use BASE_URL constant
   - Tried using ensureWWW helper function
   - Currently attempting to use request host headers

3. **XML Formatting**
   - Added proper XML declaration
   - Added XML schema and stylesheet references
   - Added trailing slashes to all URLs
   - Fixed TypeScript errors and improved type safety

### Failed Approaches
1. **BASE_URL Constant**
   ```typescript
   const BASE_URL = 'https://www.topcontractorsdenver.com';
   // Result: URLs still showed as non-www
   ```

2. **ensureWWW Helper Function**
   ```typescript
   function ensureWWW(url: string): string {
     return url.replace('https://topcontractorsdenver.com', 'https://www.topcontractorsdenver.com');
   }
   // Result: Function wasn't called on final URLs
   ```

3. **Direct URL Construction**
   ```typescript
   const url = `https://www.topcontractorsdenver.com/${path}/`;
   // Result: URLs remained non-www in output
   ```

4. **Request Host Headers**
   ```typescript
   const host = request.headers.get('host') || 'www.topcontractorsdenver.com';
   const domain = `https://${host.startsWith('www.') ? host : `www.${host}`}`;
   // Result: Host header not providing expected value
   ```

5. **Next.js Middleware**
   ```typescript
   if (!hostname.startsWith('www.')) {
     return NextResponse.redirect(`https://www.topcontractorsdenver.com${pathname}`);
   }
   // Result: Redirects work for browsing but not sitemap generation
   ```

6. **XML Template Literal**
   ```typescript
   const xml = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
     ${urls.map(url => `<url><loc>${url}</loc></url>`).join('\n')}
   </urlset>`;
   // Result: XML formatting correct but URLs still non-www
   ```

### Insights from Failed Approaches
1. The issue seems to be at the infrastructure level rather than code level
2. Next.js might be handling the request before our middleware
3. The host header might be modified by Vercel's edge network
4. String replacement and URL construction don't affect the final output
5. The problem persists across different XML generation methods

These failed attempts suggest we might need to:
1. Look into Vercel's edge configuration
2. Consider using Next.js's built-in canonical URL handling
3. Investigate if there's a Vercel-specific way to handle domains
4. Consider using a reverse proxy to force www
5. Look into DNS-level www handling

### Next Steps
1. **Critical Actions**
   - Update MongoDB password (exposed in logs)
   - Update Google Places API key (exposed in logs)
   - Remove non-www sitemap from Google Search Console

2. **Technical Tasks**
   - Debug why request host headers aren't forcing www domain
   - Consider using Next.js config for canonical domain
   - Add more logging to track URL generation
   - Test sitemap in different environments (local, preview, production)

3. **SEO Impact**
   - Monitor Google Search Console for indexing issues
   - Ensure all pages are being discovered
   - Track any duplicate content warnings
   - Verify proper handling of www vs non-www URLs

### Notes
- The sitemap is functioning and being read by Google, but the URL format needs to be fixed
- Both www and non-www sitemaps are showing the same number of pages (24)
- The core issue appears to be in the domain determination during sitemap generation
- All other functionality (redirects, content serving) is working correctly
